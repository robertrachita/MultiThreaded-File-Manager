# MultiThreaded-File-Manager
*A project implementing different methods of multi threading techniques, part of the "Threading in C#" Course at NHL Stenden Y3*


### Application description 

The application that the group wants to create therefore is a File & Folder Manager. The application will include typical features expected in a file explorer, such as file search or data transfer and multiple file manipulation commands (please refer to the following chapter for more information on the features). At the same time, these operations will make use of threading improve the performance and respect the course requirements. Additionally, a parallel SFTP client will be included as well.

### SFTP Server

The application SFTP function requires an SFTP server and its user credentials. The team recommend using Rebex Tiny SFTP Server as it was the same used during development. The link where you can download the server is as follows: https://www.rebex.net/tiny-sftp-server/#download . Unzip the .zip file, start the executable file in the folder, and allow access to the internet if it is needed. After it loaded, you can find the IP, port, username, password that you need to type in the app code in the 'SFTP.xaml.cs' file. The credentials needs to be placed when creating the server object in the SFTP's constructor. For example (IP, port, username, password): 'server = new Server("192.168.178.207", 2222, "tester", "password");' .
